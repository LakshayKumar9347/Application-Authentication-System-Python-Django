## About Author
Hi there! My name is Lakshay Kumar Kashyap and I'm a Software Developer with a focus on MERN stack development. I Love building web applications and finding elegant solutions to complex problems.

When I'm not coding, you can often find me exploring my other passions. I have a deep love for Singing, and enjoy expressing myself through music whenever I get the chance. I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen and find gardening to be a relaxing and fulfilling pastime.

I've been an avid Chess player since I was 9 years old and have competed in many local tournaments. Chess has taught me valuable lessons about strategy, planning, and resilience, which I've been able to apply to my work as a Software Developer.
